## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the Spend Smart backend on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaxenaShourya/spend-smart.git
```

### Backend Setup

#### Make the .env file in backend directory -

Create a `.env` file based of `env.example` in the backend directory and save it as .env.

#### Example .env file

```bash
# .env.example
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/spend_smart
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
ENCRYPTION_SALT=10
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password_here
```

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your MongoDB database and obtain the connection URI.

4. Create a .env file based on the .env.example file.

5. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- The development server will start running at http://localhost:3000, and you can access Spend Smart's backend routes from there.
